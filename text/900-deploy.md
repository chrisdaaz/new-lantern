# Deploy your website

Once you're done editing your textbook, go to your terminal and `sh lantern.sh` to generate a fully-fuctional static website that you can be uploaded to any web server or hosting service. This command creates and places all of your output files within a folder called `public`. The contents within the `public` folder are intended to be ready for distribution with the public.

For example, you can use [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop). [Netlify](https://netlify.com) is a web hosting service that specializes in static websites. Here's a video to demonstrate the Netlify Drop feature:

If you want to give it a try, drag and drop the `public` folder from your computer to Netlify Drop to see your textbook project live on the web. From there, you can use the Netlify to manage your website, such as adding a custom domain name.
